# Colmar-Academy
Colmar Academy Rebuild

This is my Colmar Academy project. Goal being to using HTML CSS and GitHub to effectively deploy a website. Definitely learned a lot along the way on this one. Edges could certainly be softened and I'd do things differently with the layout but I tried to be true to the spec sheet while adding some of my own touches.

Added my code for two JS games I created as easter eggs. Had a blast making both and decided to stray from the curriculum to make them more fun. Enjoy!
